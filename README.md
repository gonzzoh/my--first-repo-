# my--first-repo-

Hi, my name is Gonzalo. I kinda did this by myself because I'm pretty familiar with github. Thank god for that, because I took really long to set up my AWS "Environment". It feels funny to say it like that idk why lol >:)).

I'm a Software Engineer working at The Marcy Lab School. I like to box and lift weights.
